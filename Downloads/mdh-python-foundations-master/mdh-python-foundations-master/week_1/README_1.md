At the end of Day 3	:

* You will be able to:
	* write loops to solve more complex aggregation problems
	* apply previously learned skills with a larger set of object types
* You will understand:
	* variable types
		* tuples, dictionaries, sets
		* their use cases
		* how they differ from previously known object types

# Functions and Scope

At the end of Day 4:

* You will be able to:
	* write functions to perform arbitrary encapsulated procedures
	* use common built in functions of Python
* You will understand:
	* function declaration syntax, including:

		* how to name and access parameters
		* default parameter values
		* scope
	* how integrate the previous course materials into functions
* You will be able to:
	* apply what we have learned to:
		* break problems down into parts
		* implement those parts into functions that work together
* You will understand:
	* the greater purpose of what we covered in the previous classes
