# Object Oriented Programming

The next three evenings will be based on object oriented programming.  This will essentially incorporate much of what we have done over the last few weeks.  However, we will be thinking about all of this information in a form known as classes.

For days 5 through 8, we will be focusing on Object Oriented Programming (OOP),

At the end of Day 5:

* You will be able to:
	* write a simple class definition
	* access attributes and methods on classes	
* You will understand:
	* attributes and methods
	* the difference between an instance and class
* You will be able to:
	* identify circumstances to use classes
	* use magic methods to make more complicated classes
* You will understand:
	* magic method overriding
	* how everything in Python is an object and why it matters

# Segway to Data Manipulation Tools

At the end of Day 6:

* Today we will be putting to action the information we covered in the previous two days.  

At the end of Day 7:

* You will be able to:
	* use DataFrames within Pandas
	* obtain summary statistics
	* obtain visuals using Pandas DataFrames 
* You will understand:
	* how to interpret summary statistics
	* when, why and how to create visuals 

# Introduction to Data Science Tools

At the end of Day 8:

* You will be able to:
	* aggregate, merge and create pivot tables from DataFrames
	* use numpy statements on columns and rows of your DataFrame
* You will understand:
	* different types of merges
    * how and why you would create different views of your data
* You will be able to:
	* use scikit-learn to fit linear models
	* decide which model to use in different situations
* You will understand:
	* the process for fitting and obtaining predictions from scikit-learn's linear models
	* how to evaluate the efficacy of linear models
